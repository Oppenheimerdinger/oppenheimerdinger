# ohd

*(short for **oppenheimerdinger** — the author's handle; the plugin id, install
name, and skill prefix are all just `ohd`.)*

A research-and-development harness plugin for Claude Code, built for people
who are strong researchers but not professional developers. It encodes one
working style: interview-driven decisions, exactly one recommendation per
fork, honest gates over enforcement.

한국어 안내: [docs/USAGE-ko.md](docs/USAGE-ko.md)

## Install

    claude plugin marketplace add Oppenheimerdinger/ohd
    claude plugin install ohd@dipark

Then restart the session (or `/reload-plugins`) and run `/ohd-setup`.

Open project sessions at the project's trunk-checkout root (its CLAUDE.md and
memory live there) — never inside a campaign worktree.

## What's inside

- `/deep-solve` — user-gated hard-problem convergence harness
  (isolated / grounded modes)
- `way-of-working` — the routing layer: which tool when (produce / verify /
  review / loop), delegation & review disciplines, collaboration rules
- `campaign-land` / `campaign-status` — worktree campaign landing ritual and
  squash-safe merge verdicts
- `/ohd-new-project` — interview-driven scaffolder for a new research project
  (campaign lifecycle, protected trunk, machine×env matrix, hosts machinery)
- `review-to-convergence` — verify a finished deliverable to zero findings
- `claude-md-sanity` — audit a repo's CLAUDE.md / memory files for drift
- `/ohd-setup` — check (and on approval install) the plugins this harness
  builds on
- `assets/campaign.sh` — drop-in worktree lifecycle for any repo
  ([guide](docs/campaign-dropin.md))

Roadmap: the original outline is complete; see docs/backlog.md for carried items.
Design docs live in `docs/superpowers/specs/`.

## Version note

ohd 0.1.0 (as `oppenheimerdinger`) includes **deep-solve v0.2.2 verbatim** (formerly the
standalone `deep-solve@dipark` plugin — history:
https://github.com/Oppenheimerdinger/deep-solve, archived). If you still have
the old plugin installed, remove it to avoid double registration:

    claude plugin uninstall deep-solve@dipark

## Requirements

- deep-solve's isolated mode runs on the Claude Code **Workflow tool**;
  without it the skill announces the limitation and falls back to a manual
  Agent-tool loop (grounded mode is unaffected).
- **superpowers**: recommended — required for the full workflow from v0.2;
  v0.1 works without it. **oh-my-claudecode**: optional (ralph persistence
  mode only). `/ohd-setup` checks both.

## Uninstall / rollback

    claude plugin uninstall ohd@dipark

To pin an older version: uninstall, `git clone` this repo, `git checkout
vX.Y.Z`, then `claude plugin marketplace remove dipark` (the clone's
marketplace is also named `dipark` and would otherwise conflict) followed by
`claude plugin marketplace add /path/to/clone` and install — a local
marketplace installs whatever the working tree contains. To return to the
live version, remove the local marketplace and re-add
`Oppenheimerdinger/ohd`.
