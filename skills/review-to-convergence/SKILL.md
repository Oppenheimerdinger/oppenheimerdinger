name: review-to-convergence
description: Use when about to finalize or hand off ANY substantive deliverable — a math problem statement, a handoff/session summary, a design or plan doc, an experiment analysis, a research-informed decision, or non-trivial code — especially when it feels "simple enough", "ready as-is", or you are under time pressure to just ship it.

# Review to Convergence

A substantive deliverable is **not done when you think it is done**. It is done when an *independent* reviewer pass finds nothing left to fix.

Independent review repeatedly catches the *author's own* wrong assumptions — mistakes invisible to the person who made them. The more novel the work, the more this holds. **Your confidence is not evidence.**

## When to use
Before finalizing / handing off: a math problem statement, a handoff, a design/plan/ADR, an experiment analysis, a research-informed decision, or non-trivial code.

Genuinely trivial / throwaway / one-line work is exempt. **Anything non-trivial requires the loop.**

## The loop
1. Produce it (test-first for code).
2. Dispatch an **independent** reviewer (fresh context; reviewer ≠ author).
3. Fix Critical/Important; log Minor.
4. Re-review → step 2.
5. A pass with **zero findings** ⟹ done. Not before.

**Violating the letter of this rule violates the spirit.** Do not stop at one pass; the last pass must be clean.

## Scope guard

Use this loop only on a FIXED deliverable. If review findings start driving a
redesign of the deliverable itself (a moving target), STOP the loop and go
back to the design conversation — reviewing a mutating artifact does not
converge. A fixed deliverable normally converges in 1–3 passes; there is no
hard iteration cap (the main session sees every review and can judge), but an
unusually long run is a signal to suspect the deliverable, not to keep
looping.

## Reviewer focus by deliverable
| Deliverable | Reviewer checks |
|---|---|
| math problem | self-contained (every symbol defined, no external ref) + faithful (vs the *actual* system/code) + solvable |
| handoff | accuracy (cross-check every commit SHA / number / fact) + completeness + actionability |
| experiment analysis | self-consistent (numbers agree) + conditional-vs-unconditional (no selection blind-spot) + confidence/fidelity labelled |
| design / plan | faithful to the real system + assumptions verified |
| code | use superpowers:subagent-driven-development; each fix gets a regression test |

## Red flags — STOP, you are about to skip the loop
- "ready to hand off as-is" / "I'm confident it's clean"
- "it's a simple / three-line / obvious thing"
- "a competent reader will catch any issue"
- "no time — just ship it"
- you made a judgment call and did **not** surface it for review

**Every one of these means: dispatch the independent reviewer first.**

## Rationalizations
| Excuse | Reality |
|---|---|
| "It's simple/obvious" | The simple-looking things are exactly where subtle bugs hide. |
| "I'm confident it's ready" | Author confidence is the failure signal, not the all-clear. |
| "Reviewing is overkill" | One review is cheaper than the next session inheriting a wrong handoff. |
| "Under time pressure" | Pressure is when the loop matters most; shipping wrong costs more time. |
| "I'll review if problems show" | On novel work the problem *is* the silent wrong output — review before. |

## Why
Independent review repeatedly catches the *author's own* wrong assumptions — misread results, off-by-one / alignment bugs, data-coverage gaps, and problem statements that need several passes before they are even solvable. None of these are visible to the author (that is what makes them the author's assumptions). "Nobody has done this before" is exactly the reason to loop, not skip.

## Not
Author self-review ≠ independent review (it is a supplement). Don't loop forever on Minors (log + triage at the end). Don't invoke for genuinely trivial work.
